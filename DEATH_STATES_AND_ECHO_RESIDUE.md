# Death States and Echo Residue (v1.2)

In RedactedCraft terms, death is a **body ending** and a **pattern outcome**.

## Quiet Death (low Echo)
- Far from thin places, no corruption, no unstable craft.
- Residue fades quickly.

## Violent Death (medium Echo)
- Falls, drowning, burning, crushing, ordinary combat.
- Leaves a sharper imprint; repeated deaths can thin an area.

## Echo-fed Death (high Echo)
- Corruption, unstable crafting, shrine proximity, anomaly pressure.
- Residue sticks and can attract visitation.

## Transit Death (very high Echo)
- During waygate/portal travel or regulator failure.
- Risk of misrouting: split arrival, echo duplication, delayed return.

## Nullrock-adjacent Death (collapsed residue)
- Near Nullrock/Nullblock.
- Patterns collapse faster because Nullrock refuses continuation.
