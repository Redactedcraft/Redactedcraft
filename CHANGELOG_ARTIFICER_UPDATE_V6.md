Generated: 2026-01-13T03:36:31.041968Z

## V6 Consolidation
- Game version skipped to V6 to align with major asset consolidation.
- LorePack v1.2 (The Continuist Papers) integrated and updated to match V6.
- Assets are now centrally managed in `RedactedCraftMonoGame/Defaults/Assets/`.

## Adds to Game Data
- New inscription and fragment entries are appended only (no ID renumbering).
- No new blocks or textures are introduced here beyond what was already present in v1.1d.
- Nullblock and Artificer’s Workbench remain treated as already in-game assets.
