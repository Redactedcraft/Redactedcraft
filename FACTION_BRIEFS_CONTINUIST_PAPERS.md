# The Continuist Papers — Faction Briefs (v1.2)

These notes summarize the major factions seen in inscriptions and ruins.

## Continuists (most correct)
**Belief:** Reality is buildable if you respect structure: **Frame / Conduit / Limiter**.  
**Rightness:** Highest — matches the world's consistent behavior.  
**Failure:** Hubris; treating living worlds like solvable machines.

## Veilkeepers
**Belief:** Openings are debts; sealing and regulation prevent catastrophe.  
**Rightness:** High on risk; can become stagnation.  
**Failure:** Over-sealing until nothing can heal.

## Hearthward Covenant
**Belief:** Survival rules beat cleverness; community discipline is safety.  
**Rightness:** Practically high; inherits truth rather than defining it.  
**Failure:** Distrust of necessary progress.

## Ascendants
**Belief:** Limits exist to be broken; pain is proof; endure the bill later.  
**Rightness:** Low long-term; invites Echo attention and cascading failures.  
**Failure:** Confuses immediate success with stability.

## Echo Faith
**Belief:** The Echo is meaningful; anomalies are revelations.  
**Rightness:** Sometimes predictive, often unsafe.  
**Failure:** Romanticizing the thing that feeds on mistakes.
